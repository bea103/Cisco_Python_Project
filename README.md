# Cisco_Python_Project

The aim of this project is providing a solution to the following issue:

1.	Knowing all available devices in the network. For each device, is needed to know:
  -	Hardware version.
  -	OS version running on the device.
  -	Management ip address.
  -	Password.
  -	Modules which are installed on the device - and status of each module.
2.	Topology
3.	Seeing the interface description and interface status for each interface on each device. 
4.	Designing a tool which will be able to report end of life/end of support for the available hardware/OS in the network. 

For this purpose we have designed an graphic interface has been defined. The interface will look like this:
